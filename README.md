# hello-world
This is the hello world application. It'll help us hello the world.

This is my hello world project. Despite the fact that I have other repositories already, I thought it would be proper to create this one as well.

As of this writing (3/5/16), I'm currently enrolled in Treehouse.

As for skills, I've been coding PHP for many years off-and-on, but I wouldn't consider myself an expert yet. I still have much to learn.

In addition to PHP, I'm now learning Python and hope to learn how to make phone apps as well as control robots with code. So, that's where I'm at.
